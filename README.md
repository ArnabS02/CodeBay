# CodeBay
The project is essentially a text editor app based on HTML, CSS and Javascript created using React. 
**"npm start"** helps to run the app in development mode by opening http://localhost:3000/ on the browser of the local system. It updates when any changes are made to the code and any lint errors are visible in the console (which can also be used to view the output of any Javascript code that the user has run on the app).\
The app can be run globally by opening the following link: https://codebay.netlify.app/
### Libraries used:
i)   Codemirror\
ii)  Fortawesome\
iii) React-Codemirror2

To install the libraries and necessary requisites to run the app in a local system, run the following commands in the terminal of VSCode (or any other source-code editor in use):
__*npm install react-scripts --save*\
*npm i --save @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core*\
*npm install --save @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons*\
*npm install --save @fortawesome/react-fontawesome*\
*npm install codemirror*\
*npm install react-codemirror2 codemirror --save*__\
These commands install all necessary libraries for the app. \
Following this, the source-code is written and saved and the command __*npm start*__ is run on the terminal which opens http://localhost:3000/ on the local system to run the app.\
